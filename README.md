Final year project on predicting cardiovascular disease using BERT and neural networks with both structured and unstructured patient data.

# Cardio Disease Prediction

This is my final year project on predicting cardiovascular disease using a hybrid model that combines:
- **BERT** for unstructured text data (clinical notes)
- **Neural networks** for structured medical data (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- HuggingFace BERT
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for graphs)
